README for USB_ModeSwitch Data

Almost all new and corrected device configurations since around 2012
were collected and compiled by Lars Melin. Thank you!

Without a well-maintained base of configuration info, usb_modeswitch
would just be a useless blob of code. So:

PLEASE REPORT NEW DEVICES !

This is a data package to complement the full release package of
USB_ModeSwitch, a tool to switch multi-mode USB devices.
It is used since usb-modeswitch version 1.0.3.

Recommended version of usb-modeswitch package is 2.4.0 and above.


Installation
============

Just run "make install". To re-generate udev rules file (Note: "tcl" 
package required), type "make clean" and install again .


Tasks initiated by the rules file:
==================================

- call tiny shell script in /lib/udev which in turn calls the wrapper
  (/usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch_dispatcher) to initiate switching for known
  devices when plugged in or present at boot time

- adding symlink "gsmmodem" to appropriate connection port (out of 2-5
  ports provided by some devices); this is only a convenience feature and
  NOT needed for switching or later port operation.
  This action will be triggered for known modems only (at least switched
  once before on this system)


Explanation about config file names:
====================================

Names consist of <VendorID>:<ProductID>, respective to the default device
mode.
Should more detailed identification become necessary, one or more attributes
to test can be attached after further colons:
<VendorID>:<ProductID>:<Attribute>=<String>[:<Attribute>=<String> ...]

The strings match if they are part of the attribute content. Use "_"
to match spaces (it will match "_" too!).

Currently recognized attributes are:

uMa = USB, iManufacturer
uPr = USB, iProduct
uSe = USB, iSerial
sVe = SCSI, Vendor
sMo = SCSI, Model
sRe = SCSI, Revision

This list is easily extendable should it be necessary.

Example:
<vid>:<pid>:uPr=CDMA_Mo will match iProduct "CDMA Modem" or "MyCDMA_Mordor"


Generic config files (per vendor ID):
=====================================

Introduced in program package 2.2.0, this feature allows config files with a
name in the form <idVendor>:#<system flavour>. The default flavour is "linux".

The system parameter is taken from "/proc/version". The main use currently is
a sort of OS switch to treat all Huawei devices differently on Android.
There is no guarantee though that the /proc/version information will always
point to Android, so this method may change in future versions.

Annother form of usage is a fallback if the device ID is yet unknown. For
Huawei devices, the switching method is uniform and not likely to change,
so it is possible to provide a generic configuration.

Example files: see "12d1:#android" and "12d1:#linux"


Parameters used only in config files:
=====================================

These are not evaluated by the binary but by the wrapper.

- WaitBefore=<seconds>		delay the switching process

See also complete parameter explanation in REFERENCE.


Notes about specific devices:
=============================

- Huawei devices have a generic entry in the rules file; also there are
  generic config files for these devices (Linux/Android) as fall-back or
  as OS-specific mode control. This was suggested and approved by the
  manufacturer

- 1266:1000 (Royaltek Q110): switching method very likely but unconfirmed

- 05c6:2000 (unnamed HSDPA modem from "dealextreme"): unusually long switching
  time reported, even with MS Windoze - 30 to 40 seconds. Don't be alarmed.

- 0471:1210 (Philips chipset): had to be split after variants with different
  targets and behaviour appeared. This is not fully confirmed yet, please
  report problems.

- 1004:6190 (LG AD600): seems to require an unusually wait before starting the
  modeswitch (10 secs)
